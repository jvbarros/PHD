abstract = {In the field of the detection and prevention of preventable ADEs, several methods have been explored to decrease the rate of ADEs due to monitoring errors. This paper describes an innovative method that aims at improving patient safety by increasing ADEs' awareness of healthcare professionals. To this end, ADE-scorecards that provide healthcare professionals with retrospective data about ADEs' causes and rates have been developed. In order to evaluate the impact of this method on the ADE rate, in-field clinical tests have been set up. Data were collected by both qualitative (semi-structured interviews) and quantitative methods (log analysis and ADE rate calculation). Preliminary results reveal that ADE-scorecards are well-accepted by most of the healthcare professionals who intend to use them as discussion supports and/or learning tools. Thus, ADE-scorecards seem to be a relevant method to improve patient safety by increasing ADE-awareness of healthcare professionals.},

@article{Szarfman2002c,
abstract = {Since 1998, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has been exploring new automated and rapid Bayesian data mining techniques. These techniques have been used to systematically screen the FDA's huge MedWatch database of voluntary reports of adverse drug events for possible events of concern. The data mining method currently being used is the Multi-Item Gamma Poisson Shrinker (MGPS) program that replaced the Gamma Poisson Shrinker (GPS) program we originally used with the legacy database. The MGPS algorithm, the technical aspects of which are summarised in this paper, computes signal scores for pairs, and for higher-order (e.g. triplet, quadruplet) combinations of drugs and events that are significantly more frequent than their pair-wise associations would predict. MGPS generates consistent, redundant, and replicable signals while minimising random patterns. Signals are generated without using external exposure data, adverse event background information, or medical information on adverse drug reactions. The MGPS interface streamlines multiple input-output processes that previously had been manually integrated. The system, however, cannot distinguish between already-known associations and new associations, so the reviewers must filter these events. In addition to detecting possible serious single-drug adverse event problems, MGPS is currently being evaluated to detect possible synergistic interactions between drugs (drug interactions) and adverse events (syndromes), and to detect differences among subgroups defined by gender and by age, such as paediatrics and geriatrics. In the current data, only 3.4\% of all 1.2 million drug-event pairs ever reported (with frequencies > or = 1) generate signals [lower 95\% confidence interval limit of the adjusted ratios of the observed counts over expected (O/E) counts (denoted EB05) of > or = 2]. The total frequency count that contributed to signals comprised 23\% (2.4 million) of the total number, 10.4 million of drug-event pairs reported, greatly facilitating a more focused follow-up and evaluation. The algorithm provides an objective, systematic view of the data alerting reviewers to critically important, new safety signals. The study of signals detected by current methods, signals stored in the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research's Monitoring Adverse Reports Tracking System, and the signals regarding cerivastatin, a cholesterol-lowering drug voluntarily withdrawn from the market in August 2001, exemplify the potential of data mining to improve early signal detection. The operating characteristics of data mining in detecting early safety signals, exemplified by studying a drug recently well characterised by large clinical trials confirms our experience that the signals generated by data mining have high enough specificity to deserve further investigation. The application of these tools may ultimately improve usage recommendations.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to analyze 219 notifications of suspected adverse reactions (AR) produced by psychoactive medicaments (ARPM), notified by Brazilian psychiatrists, during a 3-month period (April 1999 up to September 2001).

METHOD: A notifying card for adverse reactions possibly produced by psychoactive medications was quarterly sent to all psychiatrists affiliated to the Brazilian Association of Psychiatry. Once each notification, dully filled in, was received, the possible adverse reaction was analyzed in order to verify the causality.

RESULTS: The psychiatrists classified as severe 50 of the ARPMs; 150 others were not considered as severe. Among the severe ones there were 3 deaths, 12 life-threatening reactions, 26 ARPMs required or prolonged hospitalization and 9 notifications described temporary disability of the patients. Among the medications, antidepressants ranked first with 122 ARPMs being notified, followed by neuroleptics (46 ARPMs) and antiepiletic medicaments (25 ARPMs). The three main organs and systems affected by the ARs were the Central Nervous System with 102 ARs, skin and mucosa with 44 and gastrointestinal with 21 ARPMs.

CONCLUSION: Considering causality, i.e., the association between the medication and the described AR, 24 cases were considered as Definite (with positive dechallenge and rechallenge, i.e., withdrawal and reintroduction of the medication) and 134 other ARPMs were classified as Probable (only dechallenge positive; only with medication withdrawal; rechallenge was not performed).},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We examine recent published research on the extraction of information from textual documents in the Electronic Health Record (EHR).

METHODS: Literature review of the research published after 1995, based on PubMed, conference proceedings, and the ACM Digital Library, as well as on relevant publications referenced in papers already included.

RESULTS: 174 publications were selected and are discussed in this review in terms of methods used, pre-processing of textual documents, contextual features detection and analysis, extraction of information in general, extraction of codes and of information for decision-support and enrichment of the EHR, information extraction for surveillance, research, automated terminology management, and data mining, and de-identification of clinical text.

CONCLUSIONS: Performance of information extraction systems with clinical text has improved since the last systematic review in 1995, but they are still rarely applied outside of the laboratory they have been developed in. Competitive challenges for information extraction from clinical text, along with the availability of annotated clinical text corpora, and further improvements in system performance are important factors to stimulate advances in this field and to increase the acceptance and usage of these systems in concrete clinical and biomedical research contexts.},

abstract = {Background: Schizophrenia represents a major burden on mental health services globally, and there are nearby 15 mil- lion cases in India. The treatment of schizophrenia promises improvement only with long-term medication, but non- compliance, adverse reactions and interactions are a major hurdle in the pathway. Methods: A six-month prospective study was conducted at the MDM Hospital, Jodhpur. Schizophrenic patients (n=205) aged 18-70 years and prescribed with antipsychotics were evaluated for drug interactions (DI) and adverse drug reactions (ADR). Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) were evaluated at baseline and endpoint; weight gain and lipid profile were evaluated at variable time points. Results: In the present study, 463 interactions occurred; 70 were of major severity. Antipsychotics were involved in 42\% of the total interactions, amongst which haloperidol (21.5\%), and olanzapine (10.3\%) were involved in most, while aripiprazole (3.48\%) was involved in least interactions. A total of 194 ADRs including 19 severe (5, ar- rhythmia, 4, tremor, and 10, EPS) were reported. Other frequently reported ADRs were insomnia, anxiety, dry mouth and EPS. Weight gain in the aripiprazole vs. olanzapine group was 0.23 kg vs. 2.74 kg (p <0.001). Pa- tients on olanzapine vs. aripiprazole experienced elevated total cholesterol (6.7 mg/dl vs. -11.2 mg/dl), low density lipoprotein (4.3 mg/dl vs. -13.2 mg/dl), and triglyceride levels (12.7 mg/dl vs. -22.13 mg/dl). Conclusion: Reasons of non-compliance and inadequate clinical improvement in schizophrenia are long-term medica- tion, ADRs and drug interactions. ADRs and interactions were least in aripiprazole prescriptions. Further long-term studies are required (German J Psychiatry 2011; 14: 26-34). Keywords:},

abstract = {AIMS: To develop and assess the use of computerized laboratory data as a detection support tool of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in hospital. METHODS: This was a retrospective observational study of 153 sequential medical admissions during a 2-month period to the 34-bed medical ward at the Hadassah University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel. Measurements made were 1) Retrospective chart review for recognized and unrecognized adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and 2) Analysis of computerizied laboratory data according to defined automatic laboratory signals (ALS) for adverse reactions. RESULTS: Forty ADRs have been detected in 38 out of the 153 hospital admissions (24.8\%). Nine reactions were considered severe. Altogether 212 ALS were generated involving 86 admissions. In 25 (65.8\%) of the ADR-positive admissions ADRs were detected through automatic signals generated from the laboratory data. ALS were detected in 56 out of the 115 (48.7\%) ADR-negative admissions. Twenty-four (60\%) of the ADRs were not recognized as such by the attending physicians. Two of these reactions were severe. ALS could have generated an alert for 19 (79.2\%) of the unrecognized reactions. CONCLUSIONS: Application of automatic laboratory signals can increase the rate of recognition of the ADRs and thereby improve medical care. The sensitivity and specificity of the method might be increased by refinement and redefinition of the signals.},

We used phenotypic side-effect similarities to infer whether two drugs share a target. Applied to 746 marketed drugs, a network of 1018 side effect-driven drug-drug relations became apparent, 261 of which are formed by chemically dissimilar drugs from different therapeutic indications. We experimentally tested 20 of these unexpected drug-drug relations and validated 13 implied drug-target relations by in vitro binding assays, of which 11 reveal inhibition constants equal to less than 10 micromolar. Nine of these were tested and confirmed in cell assays, documenting the feasibility of using phenotypic information to infer molecular interactions and hinting at new uses of marketed drugs.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the utility of a medical terminology-based method for identifying cases of possible mitochondrial dysfunction (MD) in a large cohort of youths with perinatal HIV infection and to describe the scoring algorithms.

METHODS: Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA)(®) version 6 terminology was used to query clinical criteria for mitochondrial dysfunction by two published classifications, the Enqu\^{e}te P\'{e}rinatale Fran\c{c}aise (EPF) and the Mitochondrial Disease Classification (MDC). Data from 2,931 participants with perinatal HIV infection on PACTG 219/219C were analyzed. Data were qualified for severity and persistence, after which clinical reviews of MedDRA-coded and other study data were performed.

RESULTS: Of 14,000 data records captured by the EPF MedDRA query, there were 3,331 singular events. Of 18,000 captured by the MDC query, there were 3,841 events. Ten clinicians blindly reviewed non MedDRA-coded supporting data for 15 separate clinical conditions. We used the Statistical Analysis System (SAS) language to code scoring algorithms. 768 participants (26\%) met the EPF case definition of possible MD; 694 (24\%) met the MDC case definition, and 480 (16\%) met both definitions.

LIMITATIONS: Subjective application of codes could have affected our results. MedDRA terminology does not include indicators of severity or persistence. Version 6.0 of MedDRA did not include Standard MedDRA Queries, which would have reduced the time needed to map MedDRA terms to EPF and MDC criteria.

CONCLUSION: Together with a computer-coded scoring algorithm, MedDRA terminology enabled identification of potential MD based on clinical data from almost 3000 children with substantially less effort than a case by case review. The article is accessible to readers with a background in statistical hypothesis testing. An exposure to public health issues is useful but not strictly necessary.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) to psychotropic agents are common and can lead to noncompliance or even discontinuation of therapy. There is paucity of such data in the Indian context. We deemed it worthwhile to assess the suspected ADR profile of psychotropic drugs in an ambulatory setting in a public teaching hospital in Kolkata.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A longitudinal observational study was conducted in the outpatient department (OPD) of the concerned psychiatry unit. Twenty consecutive patients per day, irrespective of their psychiatric diagnosis, were screened for suspected ADRs, 2 days in a week, over 15 months. Adverse event history, medication history and other relevant details were captured in a format as adopted in the Indian National Pharmacovigilance Programme. Causality was assessed by criteria of World Health Organization-Uppsala Monitoring Center (WHO-UPC).

RESULTS: We screened 2000 patients (68.69\% males, median age 34.4 years), of whom 429 were suspected of having at least one ADR; 84 cases had insufficient evidence about causality (WHO-UMC causality status "unlikely") and were excluded from further analysis. Thus, 17.25\% (95\% confidence interval: 15.59-18.91\%) of our study population reported ADRs with at least "possible" causality. Of 352 events recorded, 327 (92.90\%) were "probable" and the rest "possible". None was labeled "certain" as rechallenge was not performed. Patients received a median of 3.2 psychotropic drugs each. Thirty-three different kinds of ADRs were noted, including tremor (19.60\%), weight gain (15.34\%) and constipation (14.49\%). Among the incriminated drugs, antipsychotics represented the majority (57.10\%), with olanzapine topping the list.

CONCLUSIONS: This study offers a representative profile of ADRs to be expected in psychiatry out-patients in an Indian public hospital. Establishment of a psychotropic drug ADR database can be a worthy long-term goal in the Indian context.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The US Food and Drug Administration has operated the Adverse Event Reporting System since 1998. It collects all voluntary reports of adverse drug events submitted directly to the agency or through drug manufacturers.

METHODS: Using extracts published for research use, we analyzed all serious adverse drug events and medication errors in the United States reported to the Food and Drug Administration from 1998 through 2005.

RESULTS: From 1998 through 2005, reported serious adverse drug events increased 2.6-fold from 34 966 to 89 842, and fatal adverse drug events increased 2.7-fold from 5519 to 15 107. Reported serious events increased 4 times faster than the total number of outpatient prescriptions during the period. In a subset of drugs with 500 or more cases reported in any year, drugs related to safety withdrawals accounted for 26\% of reported events in that group in 1999, declining to less than 1\% in 2005. For 13 new biotechnology products, reported serious events grew 15.8-fold, from 580 reported in 1998 to 9181 in 2005. The increase was influenced by relatively few drugs: 298 of the 1489 drugs identified (20\%) accounted for 407 394 of the 467 809 events (87\%).

CONCLUSIONS: These data show a marked increase in reported deaths and serious injuries associated with drug therapy over the study period. The results highlight the importance of this public health problem and illustrate the need for improved systems to manage the risks of prescription drugs.},

@article{Mikroyannidi2012a,
abstract = {MOTIVATION: In this paper we demonstrate the usage of RIO; a framework for detecting syntactic regularities using cluster analysis of the entities in the signature of an ontology. Quality assurance in ontologies is vital for their use in real applications, as well as a complex and difficult task. It is also important to have such methods and tools when the ontology lacks documentation and the user cannot consult the ontology developers to understand its construction. One aspect of quality assurance is checking how well an ontology complies with established 'coding standards'; is the ontology regular in how descriptions of different types of entities are axiomatised? Is there a similar way to describe them and are there any corner cases that are not covered by a pattern? Detection of regularities and irregularities in axiom patterns should provide ontology authors and quality inspectors with a level of abstraction such that compliance to coding standards can be automated. However, there is a lack of such reverse ontology engineering methods and tools.

RESULTS: RIO framework allows regularities to be detected in an OWL ontology, i.e. repetitive structures in the axioms of an ontology. We describe the use of standard machine learning approaches to make clusters of similar entities and generalise over their axioms to find regularities. This abstraction allows matches to, and deviations from, an ontology's patterns to be shown. We demonstrate its usage with the inspection of three modules from SNOMED-CT, a large medical terminology, that cover "Present" and "Absent" findings, as well as "Chronic" and "Acute" findings. The module sizes are 5 065, 20 688 and 19 812 asserted axioms. They are analysed in terms of their types and number of regularities and irregularities in the asserted axioms of the ontology. The analysis showed that some modules of the terminology, which were expected to instantiate a pattern described in the SNOMED-CT technical guide, were found to have a high number of regularity deviations. A subset of these were categorised as "design defects" by verifying them with past work on the quality assurance of SNOMED-CT. These were mainly incomplete descriptions. In the worst case, the expected patterns described in the technical guide were followed by only 5\% of the axioms in the module.

CONCLUSION: It is possible to automatically detect regularities and then inspect irregularities in an ontology. We argue that RIO is a tool to find and report such matches and mismatches, for evaluations by the domain experts. We have demonstrated that standard clustering techniques from machine learning can offer a tool in the drive for quality assurance in ontologies.

The number of imaging examinations performed in clinical care is enormous, and mining large repositories of radiology reports connected with clinical data such as patient outcomes could enable epidemiological studies, such as correlating the frequency of infections to the presence or length of time medical devices are present in patients. We developed a natural language processing (NLP) system to recognize device mentions in radiology reports and information about their state (insertion or removal) to enable epidemiological research. We tested our system using a reference standard of reports that were annotated to indicate this information. Our system performed with high accuracy (recall and precision of 97\% and 99\% for device mentions and 91-96\% for device insertion status). Our methods are generalizable to other types of radiology reports as well as to other information extraction tasks and could provide the foundation for tools that enable epidemiological research exploration based on mining radiology reports.},

abstract = {Electronic health records (EHRs) are an important source of data for detection of adverse drug reactions (ADRs). However, adverse events are frequently due not to medications but to the patients' underlying conditions. Mining to detect ADRs from EHR data must account for confounders. We developed an automated method using natural-language processing (NLP) and a knowledge source to differentiate cases in which the patient's disease is responsible for the event rather than a drug. Our method was applied to 199,920 hospitalization records, concentrating on two serious ADRs: rhabdomyolysis (n = 687) and agranulocytosis (n = 772). Our method automatically identified 75\% of the cases, those with disease etiology. The sensitivity and specificity were 93.8\% (confidence interval: 88.9-96.7\%) and 91.8\% (confidence interval: 84.0-96.2\%), respectively. The method resulted in considerable saving of time: for every 1 h spent in development, there was a saving of at least 20 h in manual review. The review of the remaining 25\% of the cases therefore became more feasible, allowing us to identify the medications that had caused the ADRs.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite a consensus that the use of health information technology should lead to more efficient, safer, and higher-quality care, there are no reliable estimates of the prevalence of adoption of electronic health records in U.S. hospitals.

METHODS: We surveyed all acute care hospitals that are members of the American Hospital Association for the presence of specific electronic-record functionalities. Using a definition of electronic health records based on expert consensus, we determined the proportion of hospitals that had such systems in their clinical areas. We also examined the relationship of adoption of electronic health records to specific hospital characteristics and factors that were reported to be barriers to or facilitators of adoption.

RESULTS: On the basis of responses from 63.1\% of hospitals surveyed, only 1.5\% of U.S. hospitals have a comprehensive electronic-records system (i.e., present in all clinical units), and an additional 7.6\% have a basic system (i.e., present in at least one clinical unit). Computerized provider-order entry for medications has been implemented in only 17\% of hospitals. Larger hospitals, those located in urban areas, and teaching hospitals were more likely to have electronic-records systems. Respondents cited capital requirements and high maintenance costs as the primary barriers to implementation, although hospitals with electronic-records systems were less likely to cite these barriers than hospitals without such systems.

CONCLUSIONS: The very low levels of adoption of electronic health records in U.S. hospitals suggest that policymakers face substantial obstacles to the achievement of health care performance goals that depend on health information technology. A policy strategy focused on financial support, interoperability, and training of technical support staff may be necessary to spur adoption of electronic-records systems in U.S. hospitals.},

abstract = {Pharmacovigilance is the permanent collection and assessment of the safety data of drugs in the interest of precise knowledge of the safety profile. We monitored notifications of suspected adverse reactions (AR) produced by psychoactive medications (ARPM) in a Psychiatry Hospital, during a 4-month period. Yellow cards for adverse reaction reporting were distributed to the medical personal at the Hospital Psiqui\'{a}trico Villa Ocaranza, Pachuca Hidalgo, Mexico. For each notification, the ARPM was analyzed in order to verify causality. One hundred twelve hospitalized patients entered the study (44 male and 68 female). The mean +/- SD age of the patients was 46 +/- 4.5 years. The major diagnoses found were: schizophrenia (35.7\%), severe mental retardation (17 \%), moderate mental retardation (MMR)/epilepsy (12.5\%), MMR (8.03\%), and others (26.7\%). During the study there were 721 therapeutic regimens prescribed to patients on psychiatric service. Patients were receiving an average of 5.3 +/- 1.1 (range 4 to 8) psychiatric medications. The psychiatrists reported only 5 ARPMs in five patients (prevalence: 4.46\%). Among the drugs involved were neuroleptics (47.8\%), antiepileptic (39.1\%), and others (13.04\%). The organs and systems affected by the ARs were the central nervous system, skin, endocrinological and gastrointestinal. A causal association between the medication and the AR were classified as probable in three cases, as possible in one case, as doubtful in one case and as definite in no case.},
